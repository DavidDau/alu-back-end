# Back-End Project

This project contains backend exercises focused on working with **REST APIs** and **data serialization**. The goal is to practice fetching data from external APIs, processing it, and exporting it into different formats.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **api/** → Contains scripts for interacting with an API and handling data in multiple formats.

  * `0-gather_data_from_an_API.py` → Fetch user data from an API.
  * `1-export_to_CSV.py` → Save API data into a CSV file.
  * `2-export_to_JSON.py` → Save API data into a JSON file.
  * `3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py` → Handle nested API data structures.

## 🚀 Features

* Gather data from external APIs.
* Export structured data into **CSV** and **JSON**.
* Work with nested dictionaries and lists for flexible data handling.

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `requests` library (for API calls)

Install requirements with:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run any of the scripts inside the `api/` folder. For example:

```bash
python3 api/0-gather_data_from_an_API.py
```

Would you like me to also **open and summarize the existing README.md files** (both main and inside `api/`) so I don’t suggest duplicate descriptions?
